# My Web Development Projects

Here are some projects I've completed as part of my learning journey:

- [Cat Photo App](https://github.com/harshini1506/cat-photo-app) — A simple webpage displaying cat photos using HTML and CSS.  
- [Cafe Menu](https://github.com/harshini1506/cafe-menu) — A styled cafe menu webpage showcasing layout and design skills.  
- [Building a Set of Colored Markers](https://github.com/harshini1506/Building-a-set-of-colored-Markers) — A page demonstrating CSS color styling and element classes.

Feel free to explore these projects to see my progress and skills.
